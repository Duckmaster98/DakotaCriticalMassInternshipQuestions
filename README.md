# Dakota Critical Mass Internship Questions

# Work / Project Examples
All of the examples of work I have done have come from my time at SAIT as before this I had not done any major contributions before then.

The first and most major project I had partaken in with development is our end of program capstone project, developing an application for a client of our choosing in a team of four. Said application is a web app involving the re-selling of unused smart phones from residential and commercial clients to clients in need of them. My major contribution to the project was implementing the main use case that the clients website needed to perform, to be able to generate a shipping label for the residential or commercial seller to ship said smart phone to the sites owner. Since before this they where doing this process manually through classifieds on Craigslist and Ebay. 

I had used a Java API from EasyPost (https://www.easypost.com/) to achieve the label generation required to give to the end user to print off. There was some challenges with this such as the documentation not being exact to what was needed in the Java code, but with help from my team members with the documentation I had successfully implemented the API with our back end system. Here is the end result https://recommerce-front-end.herokuapp.com/

The second project that I had done at SAIT is involving Web Assembly and demoing it to our class, as the class’s purpose was to research emerging trends in software development. I felt like undertaking upon learning how to use a new language especially one involving web development. The demo I was trying to perform was to showcase the languages strength with calculating arithmetic over using pure JavaScript, however I had issues since my understanding of the language was fairly new so said demo turned into more of a basic showcase of Web Assembly. Unfortunately I do not have access to the recording of said presentation showing said demo, however I do have copies of the presentations as well as blog posts from when I did such. https://duckmaster98.blogspot.com

For my third work this is more of a compilation of what I have learned at SAIT rather than a single project like the others. Said programming and general knowledge that I have acquired over my four years at SAIT are
<ul>
  <li>Configuring a website using JSP, servlets, and passing objects with JavaBeans</li>
  <li>Creating a local java applcation with a GUI</li>
  <li>Understanding Binary and consersions to hexadecimal</li>
  <li>Techniques to secure local and web applications from malicious hackers</li>
  <li>Administrating, creating scripts for, and mounting a Orcale SQL database as well as a MySQL database</li>
  <li>Exploring new software technologies</li>
  <li>Bugeting, Scheduling, and creating a project outline</li>
  <li>Documenting with the IEEE standard</li>
</ul>

# Inspiration
The first form of technical inspiration for me would be open source variants of game engines, some examples being Open Roller Coaster Tycoon 2, FiveM, and Ikemen GO plus to name a few. This could also be extended to any game engine that allows for modding support. Since I’ve always found that being able to customize a game engine to suit ones use case interesting. This also does allow for a community of said game to realize features that said original developers did not foresee in its original release.

  <li>https://github.com/K4thos/Ikemen_GO</li>
  <li>https://fivem.net/</li>
  <li>https://openrct2.org/</li>
</ul>

The second form of technical inspiration would be the general tech community on YouTube, whether said tech be new or old it all does give me inspiration upon said showcases and projects they happen to take up on. Giving me inspiration to explore some of this technology in the future myself whether it would be new or old. Said channels I like to watch I’ve linked here.

  <li>https://www.youtube.com/user/LinusTechTips</li>
  <li>https://www.youtube.com/user/CuriousMarc</li>
</ul>

The third form of inspiration as of late would be with another YouTuber Wesley Kegan with managing to implement hyper car technology on a low end industrial engine with the use of 3D printing and Arduino coding. In which for said use of 3D printing and Arduino coding to improve upon existing technologies to improve efficiency. I can see plenty of uses for said technologies other than just for improving engines. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_MrPylnsDg

# Focus
My focus that I would do if given time and resources to do during said internship is using WebAssembly to implement web application solutions with as minimal JavaScript as possible while using WebAssembly modules when possible. Since what I did learn from doing explorations with WebAseembly is that one could use JavaScript as a bootloader for said WebAssembly modules and that due to the nature of WebAssembly being an implementation of the Assembly Language is having faster computational arithmetic then JavaScript. This would also improve my skills with lower level languages where garbage collection and memory management are not done for me unlike Java.

Another focus I would also be interested for said internship is learning more about is Arduino programming and implementing solutions with said micro controllers. I’ve always personally found them interesting devices to develop and implement for. It would also give me more experience with C++ since my time at SAIT was more focused on Java rather than C or C++.
